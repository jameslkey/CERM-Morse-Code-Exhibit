# Connecticut Eastern Railroad Museum's Dynamic Morse Code Exhibit
http://www.cteastrrmuseum.org/

This is the software for the Connecticut Eastern Railroad Museum's Dynamic Morse Code Exhibit. It runs on a Raspberry Pi with a PIR Motion detector, an Adafruit LCD module with the i2c LCDCharPlate and a relay driver. It is written in Python 3.4 and tries to maintain the PEP-8 standards.
*This project uses American Morse code NOT International Morse Code*, I can be modified without too many issues.
There are more options in the works:
* a workorder and config editor
* choice of Morse varients
* possibly a morse interpreter from a GPIO connected Key
* integrated menu, using the LCD Plate's push Buttonsf
